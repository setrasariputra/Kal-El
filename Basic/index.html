    <h1>List of Dungeons & Dragons deities</h1>
    <p>This is a list of deities of Dungeons & Dragons, including all of the 3.5 edition gods and powers of the "Core Setting" for the Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) roleplaying game. Religion is a key element of the D&D game, since it is required to support both the cleric class and the behavioural aspects of the ethical alignment system â€“ 'role playing', one of three fundamentals.</p>
